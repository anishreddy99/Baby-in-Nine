# RISK PREDICTION FOR COMPLICATIONS DURING PREGNANCY

The problems for the mother during the pregnancy are on the tip of the fingers but they have been troubling them during the nine months duration since ages. Mothers travel to a nearby clinics for addressing their problems that has become an orthodox method. To update this method, apps have been created for one-to-one contact for mothers i.e., telecommunication with the doctors. This helped mothers stay at home and tell about the symptoms. But, this has not helped up to the mark for the mothers as the symptoms couldnâ€™t be recognized beforehand. This adds up the cost for bad outcomes financially both to the mother and the insurance companies. Early predictions would help the mother to identify the complications.
